				<p>
					A report from <b>Animal Medicines Australia (AMA)</b> has found that
					many Australians took the opportunity to introduce a pet into their
					household during the pandemic. Their survey indicated that there was
					a significant increase in the percent of households taking in a new
					dog, fish or bird. Their research also indicated that pets had a
					number of positive influences on their lives such as:

					<li>joy and happiness</li>

				<p>
					With the increase in pet ownership the AMA are encouraging policy
					makers to consider the needs of companion animals and their owners
					when considering rental, strata and body corporate regulations are
					well as accepting animals in public places and transport.
